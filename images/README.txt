Place the Tricep Dips GIF here

Filename (required): tricep-dips.gif

You provided an attachment with a Tricep Dips GIF/image. To use it in the app:
1. Save the attached GIF file as `tricep-dips.gif`.
2. Put the file into this `images/` folder.
3. Serve the project via a local HTTP server (recommended) and open the app. The `ExerciseLibrary` entry for "Tricep Dips" will reference `images/tricep-dips.gif` automatically.

Notes:
- If you prefer embedding the GIF as a base64 data URL inside `app.js`, reply and I can embed it for you (you'd need to upload the binary or paste a base64 string).
- Example local server commands (PowerShell):
  python -m http.server 8000
  npx http-server -p 8000
